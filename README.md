Welcome to my project!

"Artificial_Intelligence.py" is the final version of the AI program I made to learn to play tic-tac-toe.
"Tic_tac_toe.py" is my old project that I had used as a framework for the AI.
The files "Storage 1", "Storage 2", and "Storage 3" are the text file used by the program to store its information during the first, second, and third times I ran it respecitvely.
"Output 1", "Output 2" and "Output 3" are files I made to paste the program's output in.
